Code Line 12: 

For this program we are using the ASCII Code, more
specifically the UPPER case ones, for that we want the letters from 65 to 90. 
So, when random.randint(65, 90) is used, it generates a random integer between 65 and 90 (inclusive),
and chr converts that integer to the corresponding uppercase letter. This is why the range 65 to 90 
is used to simulate the random selection of uppercase letters for the Scrabble tiles.
